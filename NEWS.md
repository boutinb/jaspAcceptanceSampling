# jaspAcceptanceSampling (development version)

## Added
* Added a simulated lot dataset with a numeric predictor and instructions for trying both Bayesian analyses.
* The two-region impartial prior in Bayesian Sampling has an explicit Unimodal or U-shaped choice. The location specifies a peak or an interior minimum respectively; both shapes retain the 50/50 probability split at RQL.
* Bayesian Sampling reports the acceptance number for the observed sample size and selected Bayes-factor target, shows the planning prior parameters, and provides more informative explanations when no sampling plan meets the target.

## Changed
* Moved the downloadable Bayesian examples into `tests/testthat`: saved analyses are in `jaspfiles/other`, and `data_with_predictor.csv` remains available with import instructions in the README.
* Three-region impartial priors offer Any shape as the default dropdown choice, alongside two shape restrictions. Saved selections are retained.
* Standardized option names and choice values across the module. Classical analyses saved with earlier versions retain their settings through an automatic upgrade; the bundled Bayesian examples use the updated names.
* Bayesian Sampling describes evidence for quality below versus at or above the RQL separately from whether the selected Bayes-factor target was reached, including exact target equality and targets at or below one.
* Bayesian Sampling consistently describes counted items as defectives and their rate as the proportion defective.
* Bayesian State-Space Sampling accepts multiple numeric covariates with additive effects, separate standardization and independent coefficient priors using one adjustable Cauchy scale. Coefficient outputs identify each covariate, and redundant covariates are rejected.
* Clarified state-space prior and decision-threshold labels and expanded the help with model equations, predictor interpretation, strict decision rules, smoothing/refitting behavior and predictive plot limits. These wording and help changes do not alter calculations.
* Bayesian State-Space Sampling now uses a two-component innovation mixture instead of the Gaussian state model and post-hoc predictive correction supplied in the earlier beta. Recalculating saved beta analyses fits the new model, so results may differ. Applicable data assignments, priors, MCMC settings and decision thresholds are preserved; the removed correction settings are no longer used.

* New state-space analyses default to an adaptation target of 0.97 and a maximum tree depth of 15. Saved explicit sampler settings are retained.
* State-space model selection now follows the covariate assignments. A saved beta analysis with a retained covariate assignment uses that covariate on recalculation, even if its old model selector was set to exclude predictors. Clear the assignment to fit the model without covariates.

## Fixed
* Aligned the Bayesian Sampling prior settings beside their choices in a compact layout. Inactive settings remain visible, with optional shape constraints and separate planning criteria.
* Unified the AQL/RQL labels and help in both Bayesian analyses, including the alternative term LTPD.
* Standardized capitalization across analysis controls, help text, and output tables, and shortened the state-space summary group title to Selected Parameters.
* Mathematical notation in the state-space help remains readable when the help viewer's equation rendering is unavailable.
* Corrected the measurement-variable dependency in Accept/Reject Lots and ineffective option assignments in attribute-plan tests. Ordinal-input tests now check preserved lot labels and normalized values rather than an intermediate storage type.
* State-space models initialize their compiled classes in each sampling worker, allowing parallel chains to run in fresh R processes on Windows.
* State-space tests declare fixture measurement types and preserve native option formats during cache updates; failed saved-example checks now include the underlying analysis error.
* Updated module tests for the native jaspTools input pipeline and GUI input bounds, retaining numerical reference and error-recovery coverage. Isolated the Stan-generation job's targeted rstan install from unrelated module Remotes; the shared JASP unit-test workflow is unchanged.
* State-space computational diagnostics appear after all plots, including predictor coefficients, and before the MCMC diagnostics table. Warning-only reports remain above the results.
* Bayesian Sampling retains entered defect and lot counts when they conflict with the sample size, showing an explanatory analysis error instead of rejecting the entry through a dependent input-field limit. Correcting either count restores inference results.
* Bayesian Sampling displays inference input errors on the first run, clears dependent results when inputs are invalid, and recovers when they are corrected. Replacing an errored results container now preserves the correct object type and dependencies.
* Bayesian Sampling density plots use separate adaptive grids for each prior and posterior, resolving narrow peaks and both endpoint tails. Unbounded tails remain in the curve data when the vertical display range is limited.
* Predictive beta-binomial probabilities use adjacent-count ratios to retain accuracy for highly concentrated priors, avoiding cancellation in differences of large log-Beta values.
* Three-region impartial priors now match the requested equal probability split directly and verify all three region masses. Removed the parameter penalty and fixed search limits that could distort the prior. Incompatible shape constraints and numerical calibration failures produce explicit errors.
* Two-region impartial-prior calibration enforces the selected shape and checks the achieved location and probability split. Incompatible or non-unique requests show actionable errors instead of returning a minimum labelled as a mode or an unidentified uniform prior. The solver searches adaptively rather than excluding valid priors above a fixed parameter limit.
* Bayesian Sampling calculates two- and three-region Bayes factors on the log scale without probability clipping, including extreme tails and narrow middle regions. Plans, acceptance numbers and evidence labels use the same log-scale comparisons with a small floating-point tie allowance; extreme Bayes factors are displayed in scientific notation.
* Bayesian Sampling prior plots remain available when no sampling plan meets the requested target. Fully inspected lots retain a labelled predictive count tick, and quality thresholds retain meaningful digits in tables and explanatory text.
* Bayesian Sampling corrects floating-point noise at whole-count quality limits, keeping predictive region probabilities, table labels, summaries and plot thresholds consistent at exact AQL/RQL boundaries.
* State-space Lot Number accepts numeric Ordinal labels as well as Scale data, preserving numeric lot values and ordering instead of rejecting valid Ordinal input. Clarified that missing values in assigned columns stop the analysis without dropping or imputing lots.
* Pinned the complete Stan toolchain dependency set and added a pre-restore CI check for missing pins. The existing generator versions reproduce the checked-in model headers. The Linux generation job builds the pinned RStan version from source against its locked dependencies to avoid incompatible TBB binaries.
* Strict state-space quality limits correct floating-point noise near whole defect counts. Decision probabilities are tallied directly from predictive draws so exact equality to a decision threshold remains equality.
* State-space predictive plots use bins aligned to whole defect counts, preventing artificial gaps and spikes caused by uneven numbers of counts per bin.
* Escaped percent signs in coefficient credible-interval headings so the translation check passes without changing the displayed labels.
* The initial state is calculated directly on the logit scale with the same Beta prior on its probability, and the binomial likelihood uses stable log-probability terms. This prevents rounding near zero or one from corrupting the target density under extreme custom priors or predictor effects. Saved fits are recalculated for this implementation update.
* State-space predictive probabilities use memory proportional to the observed predictive support rather than the total lot size, preserving empirical probabilities and decision rules.
* Varying numeric covariates are accepted regardless of their units when they can be standardized numerically; values outside the numerical range receive an actionable rescaling error.
* Single-lot state plots show a point and credible interval. Degenerate posterior draws and malformed coefficient draw arrays produce explicit plot errors instead of misleading density curves.
* State-space coefficient density curves extend beyond the sampled range instead of stopping at the central 99% interval, preventing visibly cut-off tails when plot axes are expanded. Posterior draws and coefficient summaries are unchanged.
* Saved state-space fits without the current model-version marker are discarded before recalculation, preventing reuse of an older model's posterior samples.
